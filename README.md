# 🏃‍♂️ Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data Analysis

This project focuses on processing and visualizing user activity data collected from a Fitbit device to derive meaningful health insights. It includes daily step counts, calories burned, and sleep patterns, analyzed through various data visualization techniques in Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 Objective

To understand individual health and activity trends using time-series data collected via Fitbit. The goal is to help users interpret patterns in their lifestyle using data analytics.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Highlights

- Cleaned and pre-processed Fitbit time-series data using `Pandas`
- Correlated steps with calories burned to understand energy expenditure
- Visualized:
  - Daily step count distribution
  - Sleep duration trends
  - Activity heatmaps over weeks and months

## 📁 Dataset

Data sourced from publicly available Fitbit datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). It includes:

- `dailyActivity.csv`
- `dailyCalories.csv`
- `sleepDay.csv`
- `heartrate_seconds.csv`

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Missing value treatment** and **data type conversions**
- Time-series analysis for daily steps and calories
- Heatmaps to show weekly and monthly activity trends
- Sleep pattern analysis by duration and time

## 📈 Visualizations

- Bar plots of step counts by day of week
- Correlation heatmap between fitness metrics
- Sleep trend line charts
- Activity heatmaps (date vs. steps)

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fitbit_analysis.ipynb
   ```

4. Run all cells to view the analysis and visualizations.

## 📌 Future Work

* Add anomaly detection for unusual health patterns
* Integrate live Fitbit API (if available) for real-time data updates
* Build a dashboard using Plotly or Dash
